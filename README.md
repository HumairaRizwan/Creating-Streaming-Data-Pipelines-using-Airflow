# Creating-Streaming-Data-Pipelines-using-Airflow
## Scenario
A project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats. Task is to collect data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.

## Objectives
In this assignment we will author an Apache Airflow DAG that will:

<ul>
    <li>Extract data from a CSV file</li>
    <li>Extract data from a TSV file</li>
    <li>Extract data from a fixed width file</li>
    <li>Transform the data</li>
    <li>Load the transformed data into the staging area</li>
</ul>
